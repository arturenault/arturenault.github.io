      <p>The other day I ran into <a href="https://maps.google.com/locationhistory/" title="Google Location History">a link</a> that got me thinking a little. If you log in, you'll see everywhere Google has seen you. This apparently only gathers data on Android devices, since many friends have told me they can't see anything, and I don't have any data on days when I was using an iPhone (I use one in Brazil). While iPhone users can <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/4388034?hl=en">fix</a> this if they'd like, I guarantee you that Apple knows just as much as Google does; and Google knows a lot.</p>

<p>Of course I knew these companies do this, and I'm sure Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, etc. have the same systems in place, but when I saw it on my own computer screen and saw that Google knows literally every place I've been to almost every day for the past two years, it felt a little disconcerting. It connected an abstract, unseen fear to concrete evidence. It was an uncomfortable realization that I'm always being watched; that every time I turn on my phone I am also broadcasting my location to a data center in an unknown location, where a company will use this information to modify their services and garner add revenue.</p>

<p>But the part that freaked me out the most: none of this actually bothers me.</p>

<p>After all, it is something I consented to when I bought the phone and used it each day. I'm fine with it if it means that I can use the GPS for getting around. Most of us agree to this. Which is a change; if you had asked someone in the 80s if they'd be interested in being tracked at all times by a large corporation, they'd probably throw their walkman at you. Nowadays, this is commonplace and it's accepted; it just shows how much we've changed.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, I went out and tried to see what similar data I can get about myself online. It turns out that <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dyi?x=Adnym-sxffb4pwMU">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/takeout">Google</a> let you download a copy of your data. It's a simple process; you click a button, then a few hours later they send you an e-mail with a download link. The downloads are huge: my Facebook file took up 1.02 GB, and my Google information was split into two files: one containing every e-mail I have (over 7 GB, so I didn't touch it), and one with other Google data, 1.31 GB in size.</p>

<p>The Google one isn't that interesting to me. It's mostly Google+ stuff (which I don't use), so it includes my few photos, posts, etc. The file also has my location history, profile info, and hangout history in JSON, all of which are super annoying to read, and all of the YouTube videos and Drive files I've uploaded.</p>

<p>Facebook is a bit better. First of all, it is all organized into a nice html file you can open and navigate with your browser. It has:</p>

<ul>
<li>my profile info</li>
<li>my contact info</li>
<li>everything that has ever been on my wall/timeline</li>
<li>all of my photos and videos</li>
<li>lists of all my current and former friends</li>
<li>every message I've ever sent or received (a 42 MB html file)</li>
<li>every event I've ever been invited to</li>
<li>my settings</li>
<li>security info - including every time I've changed my password or settings and every IP address that I've ever logged in from</li>
<li>ads - essentially, ad topics I'd be interested in in list form, as well as all the ads I've clicked (a whopping 4, all by accident)</li>
</ul>


<p>Some of these are really interesting. The facial recognition info available in my photos is something I couldn't find anywhere else. Perhaps my favorite is the ad info though. The long list includes things I'm actually interested in, like "#Monty Python and the Holy Grail", "#Application software", and "#Stroopwafel." But it also includes things I'm not interested in, such as "#Sewing needle", "#Rain (entertainer)" (no idea who this guy is), and "#Argentina national football team." Finally, there's also a lot of completely random stuff, like "#Communes of France," "#List of awards and nominations received by How I Met Your Mother," and "#Bozo the Clown"&mdash;I wonder if I read these wikipedia articles at some point. The ridiculousness of these topics is part of why I pretty safe being tracked for data.</p>

<p>This is obviously not all the data they have about me. Facebook and Google certainly remember every search I've made and every link I've clicked on, and a lot of other metadata. But I doubt we'll get to see that very soon. And other companies have tons more data they don't even release.</p>

<p>But really, the reason I like companies recording a comprehensive, automatically collected diary of my activity is that I have a comprehensive, automatically collected diary of my activity. It's a fantastic way to look to the past and learn about yourself. I spent quite some time reading over my Facebook messages and remembering the fantastic emoticons of 2008, such as xP.</p>

<p>And even better, using Google's location history, I got to explore any period of time I chose.</p>

<p>Here's March 12, 2014, a typical day of Columbia class:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/fall_semester.png" style="width:500px !important; height:433px !important"></p>

<p>Here's December 21, 2013, driving around in São Paulo:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/sp.png" style="width:500px !important; height:433px !important"></p>

<p>This is a weekend I spent in Amsterdam, October 11-12, 2013:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/amsterdam.png" style="width:500px !important; height:316px !important"></p>

<p>And here's the month preceding my 20th birthday on January 21, 2014, an amazing trip around the world:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/world.png"></p>

<p>I think it's pretty awesome that I get to look back at these, and relive some of the cool moments in my life without even having to write about them. It is a difficult line to toe, considering the NSA controversies, but when properly used the right way this information is an amazing resource that can be fascinating to look at.</p>
