About two years ago, I visited the Louvre with a friend and he asked me a question that has stuck with me since:

"Why do people go to art museums?"

And there I was, a transatlantic flight away from home, having paid over twenty euros for a ticket to the largest single art museum in the world, without a good answer to that question.

As a self-proclaimed rational intellectual, I definitely had some sort of self-aggrandizing excuse. Great minds made these paintings, and other great minds through the ages had looked at them and decided they were masterpieces. *This* is real culture, I thought. The mass-produced crap that people consume nowadays is empty, but this carries *real meaning*.

What, where and how? I had no idea.

But I had to know the names of all these artists and works, and I had to pay twenty dollars to see them at the Louvre, and I had to fail miserably at grasping the fact that this guy I heard about had sat in front of the same canvas centuries earlier and painted something. I didn't really have fun while doing it, but I felt like I had to: to seem smart and to feel good about myself.

That's why I think most people go to museums--out of obligation. That's why I went for most of my life. We've built this idea that museums are among the top tourist attractions in any given city. You just don't go to Madrid and not see *Guernica*, or to New York and not stop by the Met.

> Why do we have this attitude with art, but not with music or theater for example? 

I was thinking of this when I went to the Met today to write an essay for Art Humanities. I observed the people around me and could tell most of them were tourists. Some of them, especially the older ones, actually did stop, read the notes, and pay close attention to all the details in the painting for up to a minute. But most of them didn't. Most were just walking around and glancing at the artwork, which is what I usually would do, and even occasionally taking selfies with the art.

Those people didn't come here because they wanted to be inspired by art, or at least it didn't seem like they did; I say that because I was exactly like them. I went to museums because I felt like I should, but I really didn't enjoy it. And I didn't think much of it.

But that's until I took Art Hum and saw how much more there really is to art. The simple fact that every brushstroke is a choice, that art is always trying to say something and transmit a certain sensation, really changes the way you see art. It's something you do more than just glance at; if you're going to pay twenty euros simply because you want to be a member of the crowd frantically taking pictures of the *Mona Lisa*, maybe that money would have been better spent on something else.

My point with this is not that everyone should take Art Hum or learn to look at and appreciate art. Rather, I'm questioning this whole stigma we have towards museums, as all-important tourist destinations and cultural experiences. This obligation to visit museums could lead you to miss out on less traditional things to do in a city, but could interest you way more. 

Art will tell you a lot, but only if you listen. And I think a lot of people don't know what to listen for; I know I didn't for a long time. Museums have to stop being an obligation and start being a pleasure. They're really aren't for everyone, and we'd all benefit if we stopped pretending they were.
